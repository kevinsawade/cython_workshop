You can write cython files (.pyx) files in a similar manner than you would write normal python files (.py), compile them and import the generated shared object (.so) as a module into your python code. Doing this allows you to greatly decrease the computational overhead at run time, i.e. make python faster. You may find the best use in cython if you use it to compile specific computationally-heavy functions.\n",

    "# Python and Cython performance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is python slow\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of python is its platform-independence. This independence was realized by including a python virtual machine that handles the task of translating the python bytecode generated from .py files into machine code that can be executed on the CPU of your computer. This versatility makes python slower compared to compiled languages that create platform-specific machine code (gcc does not even create bytcode from the source files and goes straight to machine code).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call a function from within python that has been declared, translated and compiled in/from a .pyx file, the python VM skips the translation of bytecode to machine code and goes straight to the correct lines of machine code from the compiled file. The translation of python code into C code is handled by the cython module. This gives us a speedup for free. All we have to do is rename the file into .pyx and do the compilation steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dynamic and static typing\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the speedup can be greatly improved with **static typing**. Python is a dynamically typed language. This allows us to do fun stuff like adding integers to floats:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> print(1 + 2.1)\n",
    "3.1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Lower level programming languages (like C) are statically typed. Every variable needs to be declared with its datatype. The speedup when using static typing comes from the compilers optimizing the machine code for that specific datatype. A simple operation like `a + b` can become quite some time intensive. The interpreter asks for the datatype of a and b, the implementation of addition for the given datatypes, and calls this function. Inside the addition function the types of the variables might be casted to different types.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can achieve a speedup in our python code by simply typing variables statically. For this we use the `cdef` keyword followed by the variable type and name:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cython\n",
    "cdef int i\n",
    "```\n",

That's all they're doing, basically. If we wan't to tap into these super fast calculations (like C++s `std::vector`). This is where python buffers come into play. Buffers can be used to expose an object's data in a byte-format. Python buffers is what NumPy uses to make your code run faster. With these buffers NumPy build contiguous arrays of boxed data.
